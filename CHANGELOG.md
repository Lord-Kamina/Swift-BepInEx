# CHANGELOG

## Version 0.2:
   - Changed:
     - Use `Option` instead of `Flag` for enabling the doorstop. This enables using `--enable-doorstop <true|false>` and should make it compatible OOB with the r2modmanPlus launcher.
     - Added the `--target-assembly` alias for the same reason. Note: If the game isn't launching and you can't figure out why, it's worth a shot to manually set the `--baseDir` option correctly.

## Version 0.1: Initial Release
